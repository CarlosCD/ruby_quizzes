# Collinearity

## Theoretical Material

You are given two vectors starting from the origin (x=0, y=0) with coordinates (x1,y1) and
(x2,y2). Your task is to find out if these vectors are collinear.  
Collinear vectors are vectors that lie on the same straight line. They can be directed in the same
or opposite directions. One vector can be obtained from another by multiplying it by a certain
number. In terms of coordinates, vectors (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are collinear if
(x1, y1) = (k*x2, k*y2) , where k is any number acting as a coefficient.

## Problem Description

Write a method like:

```Ruby
# Expects 4 numeric values
def collinearity(x1, y1, x2, y2)
  # ...
end
```

Returning a Boolean meaning whether the vectors `(x1,y1)`, `(x2,y2)` are collinear or not.

    All coordinates are integers
    -1000 <= any coordinate <= 1000

## Notes

All vectors start from the origin `(0, 0)`.

Be careful when handling cases where x1, x2, y1, or y2 are zero to avoid division by zero errors.

A vector with coordinates `(0, 0)` is collinear to all vectors.

## Examples

    (1,1,1,1) ➞ true
    (1,2,2,4) ➞ true
    (1,1,6,1) ➞ false
    (1,2,-1,-2) ➞ true
    (1,2,1,-2) ➞ false
    (4,0,11,0) ➞ true
    (0,1,6,0) ➞ false
    (4,4,0,4) ➞ false
    (0,0,0,0) ➞ true
    (0,0,1,0) ➞ true
    (5,7,0,0) ➞ true
